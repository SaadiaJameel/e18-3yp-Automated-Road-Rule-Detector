## Introduction

A system that will be mounted onto a vehicle that senses the speed, line crossing and the distance from the vehicle to an incoming vehicle on the other lane while crossing a line. All these sensed details will be used to determine the severity of the vehicleâ€™s road-lines based road rule breakage.
