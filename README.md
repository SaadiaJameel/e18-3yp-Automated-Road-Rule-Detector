This is a system designed to analyse vehicles in order to gather information about their road rule breakings specifically when vehicles are overtaking. The primary user of this system are the officials of the motor traffic department/police and they will be able to analyse individual vehicles in order to get an idea about the driver's disipline in the road. The hardware nodes will be set in/on the vehicles and the officials will be given an app in order to analyse the vehicles.
